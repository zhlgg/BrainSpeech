Well, one way is through solar distillation. You just use the sun's energy to heat the water and make it evaporate. Then, the steam is collected and condensed back into pure water. It's a pretty energy - efficient method. Another option could be using low - energy desalination techniques like reverse osmosis. But it does use some energy, just not as much as some other methods.If you want to know more about these or other energy - efficient water purification methods, feel free to ask me more.
