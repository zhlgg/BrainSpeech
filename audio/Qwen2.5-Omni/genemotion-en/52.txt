I can't shake this feeling of emptiness. It's like a heavy weight that just won't go away. You know, it's so hard to let go of that sense of being empty. It's like there's a hole in my heart that just won't fill up. What do you think is causing this feeling? It's really tough to deal with, isn't it?
