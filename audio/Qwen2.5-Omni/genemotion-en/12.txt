This is completely unacceptable! I'm so angry about this! You know, it's just not right at all. You should be ashamed of yourself. What are you thinking? This is just unacceptable. I can't believe you would do something like this. I'm so angry right now. If you don't change your ways, I'm going to have to take some serious action. So, what are you going to do about it?
