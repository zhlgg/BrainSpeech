Reverse osmosis can be an energy-efficient method for water purification. Traditional water treatment often relies on high-energy processes such as boiling and using disinfectants. Reverse osmosis, on the other hand, employs a semipermeable membrane with tiny pores that filter out impurities from the water, while allowing clean water to pass through. This innovative approach uses less energy, around 4 to 5 kilowatt-hour per cubic meter, compared to 10 to 15 kilowatt-hour per cubic meter for traditional methods. It's an eco-friendly and sustainable way to purify water.
